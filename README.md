# Book-Store-App
An application created with React and Google Books API to help you keep track of the books you want to read!

To get started you have to install this application on your local machine by:

1. Cloning the repo onto your machine:
git clone '//repo url//'

2. yarn install

3. yarn start

Once you have this cloned onto your machine, you are able to sign in with two username and password combinations:
username: harry   password: potter
username: hermione   password: granger

You will be directed to your own personal Book Shelf! You can get started saving books to your 'shelves' by going to the Search page and searching for any type of book by author, title, or genre. Then you can use the drop down to add  them to whichever shelf you want. Go to your bookshelf to view all the books you've saved and move them to any shelf, or delete them from your list all together!
